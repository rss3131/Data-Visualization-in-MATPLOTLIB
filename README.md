# Data-Visualization-in-MATPLOTLIB
Matplotlib is the "grandfather" library of data visualization with Python. It was created by John Hunter. He created it to try to replicate MatLab's (another programming language) plotting capabilities in Python. It is an excellent 2D and 3D graphics library for generating scientific figures.
