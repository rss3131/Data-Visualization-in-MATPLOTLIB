# Data-Visualization-in-MATPLOTLIB
Matplotlib is the "grandfather" library of data visualization with Python. It was created by John Hunter. He created it to try to replicate MatLab's (another programming language) plotting capabilities in Python. It is an excellent 2D and 3D graphics library for generating scientific figures.  

Matplotlib is a widely-used Python library for creating high-quality 2D and 3D visualizations. It provides a wide range of functions and tools for creating various types of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and pie charts. Matplotlib is versatile, allowing users to create both static and animated visualizations, and it supports multiple data formats, such as NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes.

In order to develop my data visualization skills in Python, I have utilized Matplotlib to create a variety of visualizations showcasing different types of plots. Through this practice, I have gained experience and proficiency in creating effective and informative visualizations that communicate insights from data.
